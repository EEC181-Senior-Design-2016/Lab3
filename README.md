# Lab3

Part 1:
Create a custom master that will increment the value in our custom slave component by 1 if the value
is nonzero.
Status: completed

Part 2:
Create a custom master that will take in 10 16-bit integers from the SDRAM slave, find the max and
min numbers, and then write them to specific addresses in the SDRAM slave.
Status: completed

Part 3:
Create a custom master that will take in input of power of 2 16-bit integers from the SDRAM, sort
them, find the average, and then write them into specific addresses in the SDRAM.
Status: incomplete
Current state: Will take in 10 integers and store them in a 1D array in the master
